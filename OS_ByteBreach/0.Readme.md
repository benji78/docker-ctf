# CTF Vulnerable Code Demos

This repository contains three short **C** programs that each demonstrate a different classic vulnerability:

1. Easy:Format String Vulnerability (`CTF_Fmt_Str_Vuln.c`)
2. Medium:Buffer Overflow(`CTF_BoF.c`)
3. Hard:Use-After-Free(`CTF_UaF.c`)

They are **intentionally** insecure to help you learn about and practice exploiting common C vulnerabilities. **Use at your own risk** and never run these on production systems.
