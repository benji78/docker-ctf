Vulnerability Overview:
  > gets() reads user input without bounds checking.
  > By entering more than 64 bytes, you overwrite saved EBP and return address on the stack.
  > The exploit is to redirect execution to hidden_shell(), which reveals the encoded flag (ZmxhZ3tiMGZfc2hlbGxfYWNjZXNzfQ==) and spawns a shell. The decoded flag is flag{b0f_shell_access}.

Exploitation Steps (Simplified):
1. Compile with minimal protections:
    gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o CTFBoF CTFBoF.c
    ./CTFBoF
3. Find the address of hidden_shell():
 For example:
  objdump -d CTFBoF | grep hidden_shell
  or
4. nm CTFBoF | grep hidden_shell
    >Suppose you get 0x080484cb <hidden_shell> (this varies per environment).
