This CTF is all about Web interfaces.
There are 3 challenges,
1. SQL injection:
Username: admin
Password: 1' OR '1'='1
2. Insecure URL Manipulation:
after logging to one account (admin, user1 or user2)
you can change in the url the profile and connect to the other accounts
(2.2 Weak passwords:
you can bypass the login with brute force because the passwords are admin and user1)
3. Table deletion from login page
If you replace
Username: admin'; DROP TABLE users; --
Password: anything
you get an optional error so you reload the page
and when you try to connect again with the right credentials you see that the table users was deleted

to fix this : rerun python database.py and backend.py
and it works again.
